# Image processing

Graphic cards (GPUs) have the ability to chop images (called a *texture*) into smaller fragments, which are then fed to the active threads. For this task, the graphics cards are equipped with special accelerated memory types which require the image to be uploaded before being used. Like vegetables in restaurant kitchens, the elements have to be chopped and ready before cooking starts. ****we need to talk about this paragraph and improve it ****
