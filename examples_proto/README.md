# Shader Gallery

The following is the list of examples present in this book and more from our excellent contributors and readers. Find your favorite example and play around with it. It's good idea to change the values or commenting out a part of the code to understand what each part of the code is doing. Once you feel comfortable with the example, try if you can create something unique and new by tweaking it bit by bit, then share your experiment with "share" button at the top of the editor so that someone can find it and study.

## Featured shaders

Featured examples shared by our readers and students. We are looking forward to see a lot more shaders created with the [GLSL editor](http://editor.thebookofshaders.com/). Please share your masterpiecess to [@bookofshaders](https://twitter.com/bookofshaders).

## Getting started
### "Hello World!"

Usually the "Hello world!" example is the first step to learning a new language. In GPU-land rendering text is an overcomplicated task for a first step, instead we'll choose a bright welcoming color to shout our enthusiasm!

Read ["Hello World!"](../02) to learn more.

### Uniforms

Learn how to use Uniform variables. Uniform variables, or simply *uniforms* are the variables that carry information equally accessible from all of the threads of your shader. The [GSLS editor](http://editor.thebookofshaders.com/) has three uniforms set up for you.

Read [Uniforms](../03) to learn more.

```glsl
uniform vec2 u_resolution; // Canvas size (width,height)
uniform vec2 u_mouse;      // mouse position in screen pixels
uniform float u_time;	  // Time in seconds since load
```

## Algorithmic drawing
### Shaping functions

Shaping functions is fundamental technique that is recursively used throughout this book that let you control the variation of value at will. Study how different functions of x are used to create different shapes and try making your own function.

### Color

Familiarize yourself with how to express colors in shaders. The examples cover how to mix colors and beautifully animate them over time as well as conversion between two different models(RGB and HSB).
In GLSL, colors are simply just vectors, which means you can easily apply the concepts and techniques you learn here to other
