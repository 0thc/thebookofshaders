# Shader Gallery

## Patterns

Repetitive patterns are perfect theme for computational sketching. Different from conventional way of drawing, shaders lets you draw everything parallelly at once. Instead of repeating the same procedure many times, you will wrap and repeat the "space". Sounds like Sci-Fi? Let's find out what it really means.
