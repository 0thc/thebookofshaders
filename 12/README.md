We made pseudo random values from a sine wave, then from it we construct noise. We went from the absolute chaos to smooth random variations we can control.
With it we were able to suggest more organic visual gestures. But we still far away from the “real” thing. If we look to satelites images, coherent structers emerge from mountans formation, looking closely to the surface of a leave we will see a clear an inner pattern. This surfaces speaks about the forces involve on their creation. On the tension of the laws applied apply to them together with the forces of their surrandings.
The next chapters in our quest on learning how to mimic nature will be to learn about iterations. More precisely iterations on time and iterations on space.
